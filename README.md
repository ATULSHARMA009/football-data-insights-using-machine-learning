# 🏟️ English Premier League Match Analysis

## 📊 Project Overview

This project explores English Premier League (EPL) match data to generate insightful features and predictive insights using data science techniques. The focus is on **match statistics**, **form-based metrics** (like goals in last 5, 15, 30 games), and **machine learning** models for outcome prediction.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Clean and preprocess raw EPL match data.
- Create form-based features such as:
  - Goals scored/conceded in the last 5, 15, and 30 matches.
  - Points accumulated over recent matches.
  - Home vs away performance trends.
- Build predictive models to forecast match outcomes.
- Visualize trends in team performance and league dynamics.

---

## 🧠 Key Skills & Tools

- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** – data cleaning & manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – data visualization
- **Scikit-learn** – model building
- **MySQL** – structured data storage
- **Tableau / Power BI** – dashboard visualization (optional)

## 📈 Sample Features

- `goals_last_5`: Number of goals a team scored in the last 5 matches
- `points_last_15`: Points collected over last 15 matches
- `avg_goals_conceded_home`: Average goals conceded at home
- `form_diff`: Difference in form between the two teams

---

## 🔍 Future Work

- Improve feature selection using feature importance metrics.
- Tune machine learning models for better performance.
- Deploy as a live dashboard or web app (Streamlit/Flask).
